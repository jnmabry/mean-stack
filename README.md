# AARF: Ashland Animal Rescue Fund - Final Project

This is a website revamp of http://aarfky.com/. It is still a work in progress, but you can get the overall idea of where I wanted to go with the look and feel of the website.  

## My Requirements
1. Implemented Bootstrap to make site responsive
2. Angular, CSS, HTML and Javascript for the front-end
3. Built with Node.js, Express.js and Mongodb on the back-end

## Difficult and Notable Things I Learned
- Connected to an API using AJAX to populate dogs on the Adopt Page
- Generated the HOW YOU CAN HELP section on the about page using an Object Array and ng-Repeat
- Getting Mongodb running then using it to POST and GET data on the site

## Things That I Need To Fix
- Responsive views need to be tweaked at different sizes
- Text and Layout for EVENTS and PROGRAMS needs edited
- Getting Mongodb running then using it to POST and GET data on the site
- Navbar needs to be collapsable after screen size goes down to mobile 
- Add photos or icons to the HOW YOU CAN HELP section items
